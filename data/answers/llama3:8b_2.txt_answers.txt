Q1: Advanced Scenario 2: Test Questions
4. What is the maximum amount Jeff and Jane are eligible to claim for the Child Tax Credit (CTC)
a. $6,000
b. $4,000
c. $3,000
d. $2,000

A1: The correct answer is c. $3,000.

According to the IRS, the maximum amount of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) that Jeff and Jane are eligible to claim for their two children is $1,400 each ($3,000 total). This is because both Joan and Jim are under 17 years old, which meets the age requirement for the CTC. The credit amount is reduced by $50 for each child over 16 years old, but since neither of their children is over 16, they qualify for the full amount.

Note that Jeff's income ($23,000) and Jane's income ($21,000) are not relevant to determining the maximum CTC amount, as it is based solely on the age and citizenship status of the children.
