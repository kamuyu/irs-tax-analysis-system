Q1: Advanced Scenario 2: Test Questions
4. What is the maximum amount Jeff and Jane are eligible to claim for the Child Tax Credit (CTC)
a. $6,000
b. $4,000
c. $3,000
d. $2,000

A1: To determine the maximum amount Jeff and Jane can claim for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), we need to consider the eligibility requirements for each child under IRS rules.

For the 2023 tax year, the Child Tax Credit is up to $2,000 per qualifying child. A qualifying child must meet the following criteria:

1. **Age:** The child must be under age 17 at the end of the tax year.
2. **Relationship:** The child must be a son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them (e.g., grandchild).
3. **Residency:** The child must have lived with the taxpayer for more than half of the tax year.
4. **Support:** The child cannot have provided more than half of their own support during the tax year.
5. **Citizenship:** The child must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident alien.

Given these criteria:

- Joan, age 7, qualifies for the CTC because she is under 17 and meets all other requirements.
- Jim, age 15, also qualifies because he is under 17 and meets all other requirements despite being paid by his parents to provide care (since they provided more than half of his support).

Therefore, Jeff and Jane can claim the Child Tax Credit for both Joan and Jim.

**Calculation:**

- $2,000 per qualifying child x 2 children = $4,000

Thus, the maximum amount Jeff and Jane are eligible to claim for the Child Tax Credit is:

b. $4,000

Q2: 5. The Springs qualify for the Child and Dependent Care Credit
a. True
b. False

A2: To determine if the Springs qualify for the Child and Dependent Care Credit, let's review the requirements:

1. **Eligibility for the Children**: 
   - The credit is available for expenses incurred for the care of qualifying persons to enable the taxpayer(s) to work or look for work.
   - Qualifying children are under age 13 when the care was provided.

2. **Qualifying Expenses**:
   - Payments must be made to a care provider (not a dependent) for services related to child care.
   - The expenses cannot exceed $3,000 for one qualifying person or $6,000 for two or more qualifying persons.

3. **Earned Income Requirement**:
   - Both Jeff and Jane need to have earned income since the credit is based on work-related expenses.

4. **Claiming the Credit**:
   - The care must be provided so that both spouses can work (or look for work).

In this scenario:

- Joan, age 7, qualifies because she is under 13.
- Jim cannot qualify as a child care provider since he is their dependent and over the qualifying age of 12.

The $2,000 paid to Jim does not count towards the credit because expenses paid to a dependent (like their son) do not qualify for the credit.

Given these considerations:

**Answer: b. False**

Jeff and Jane cannot claim the Child and Dependent Care Credit based on payments made to their son, Jim, since he is considered a dependent and over the age limit for qualifying care providers.
