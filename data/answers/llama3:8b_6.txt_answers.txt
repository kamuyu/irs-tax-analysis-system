Q1: Advanced Scenario 6: Test Questions
13. David is eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit on his 2024 tax return.
a. True
b. False

A1: b. False

According to the IRS, the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) can be claimed for qualified education expenses paid or incurred during the taxpayer's first four years of post-secondary education. Since David took management courses at a community college and was less than half-time student, he does not meet the requirements to claim the AOTC.

Additionally, since David did not attend a degree-granting institution, he would not be eligible for the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) either.

However, David may still be able to claim the education credits on Form 8863 if his courses qualify as "qualified education expenses" under the Higher Education Act of 1965.

Q2: 14. For which of the following IRA distributions will David owe an additional tax of 10%?
a. $2,000 for tuition
b. $500 for emergency repairs
c. Both a and b
d. Neither a nor b

A2: The correct answer is c. Both a and b.

According to the IRS, if you take an early distribution from your IRA before age 59 1/2, you may be subject to a 10% additional tax. The exceptions include distributions taken for qualified education expenses (e.g., tuition) or unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding 10% of adjusted gross income.

In this scenario:

* $2,000 for tuition: This is a qualified education expense, and David would not owe an additional tax.
* $500 for emergency repairs: This is not a qualified educational expense or medical expense, so David would be subject to the 10% additional tax on this distribution.

Since both distributions are from his IRA, but only one (emergency repairs) meets the exception, the correct answer is c. Both a and b.
