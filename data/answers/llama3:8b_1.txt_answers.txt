Q1: Advanced Scenario 1: Test Questions
1. Sharon qualifies for Head of Household filing status.
a. True
b. False

A1: The correct answer is:

a. True

Sharon meets the qualifications for Head of Household (HOH) filing status because:

* She has a qualifying dependent child, Lea, who lived with her for more than half the year (Lea is age 10).
* She paid more than half of the support for Lea.
* Her spouse, Daniel, does not live with her and has no dependents.

As a result, Sharon can claim HOH filing status on her 2024 tax return.

Q2: 2. Who qualifies to claim the Earned Income Credit (EIC) also known as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
for Lea?
a. Sharon
b. Daniel
c. Both Sharon and Daniel
d. Neither Sharon nor Daniel

A2: The correct answer is:

a. Sharon

According to the IRS, to qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC), you must meet certain requirements, including:

* Being a U.S. citizen or resident alien with a valid Social Security number
* Having earned income from a job or self-employment
* Meeting income and family size tests

Since Sharon is Lea's custodial parent, she meets the above criteria and can claim Lea as her dependent on her 2024 tax return. As Lea is under age 19 (or a full-time student under age 24), Sharon can also claim Lea for EIC purposes.

Daniel, who has not had any contact with Lea or contributed to her support since moving out in February 2022, does not qualify as a custodial parent and therefore cannot claim the EIC.

Q3: 3. Sharon is required to report her lottery winnings as income on her federal tax return.
a. True
b. False

A3: The correct answer is:

b. False

According to IRS regulations, lottery winnings are not taxable if they are reported on a Form W-2G and the winnings do not exceed $5,000. Since Sharon's lottery winnings were $2,000, which is below the threshold, she does not need to report them as income on her federal tax return.
