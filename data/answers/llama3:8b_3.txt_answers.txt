a. $3,860
b. $3,620
c. $3,580
d. $3,320

c. $3,580

Let's break down the unreimbursed qualified medical expenses reported on Form 8889, Part II:

1. Physical therapist visits ($500)
2. Unreimbursed doctor bills ($1,000)
3. Prescription medicine ($280)
4. Replacement of a crown ($1,500)
5. Deep cleaning for teeth ($300)
6. Over the counter medication ($40)

Total unreimbursed qualified medical expenses: $4,620

However, we need to subtract the gym membership expense ($260) because it's not specifically for medical treatment.

Therefore, the total unreimbursed qualified medical expenses reported on Form 8889, Part II is:

$4,620 - $260 = $3,580
