Q1: Advanced Scenario 6: Test Questions
13. David is eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit on his 2024 tax return.
a. True
b. False

A1: To determine whether David can claim the American Opportunity Credit (AOC) for the 2024 tax year, we need to review the eligibility criteria for this credit:

1. **Student Status**: The student must be pursuing a degree or other recognized education credential and be enrolled at least half-time for one academic period during the tax year.

2. **Time Limit**: The AOC can only be claimed for the first four years of post-secondary education.

3. **Qualified Expenses**: These include tuition, fees required for enrollment or attendance, and course materials needed for a student’s courses.

4. **Income Limits**: There are income limits that reduce the credit amount available to taxpayers with higher incomes.

Based on the scenario provided:
- David was enrolled in two management courses at a community college but was less than half-time. This disqualifies him from claiming the AOC because it requires at least half-time enrollment.
  
Therefore, the correct answer is:

b. False

Q2: 14. For which of the following IRA distributions will David owe an additional tax of 10%?
a. $2,000 for tuition
b. $500 for emergency repairs
c. Both a and b
d. Neither a nor b

A2: To determine whether David owes an additional tax of 10% on his IRA distributions, we need to consider the rules regarding early withdrawals from an Individual Retirement Account (IRA).

Generally, if you take a distribution from your traditional or Roth IRA before age 59½, you may be subject to an additional 10% early withdrawal penalty. However, there are exceptions to this penalty.

1. **$2,000 for tuition:** Under IRS rules, distributions from an IRA used to pay for qualified higher education expenses can avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty. Qualified expenses include tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational institution. Since David used $2,000 of his IRA distribution for tuition, this amount is exempt from the additional 10% tax.

2. **$500 for emergency repairs:** Distributions taken for purposes other than qualified higher education expenses do not qualify for the penalty exemption. Therefore, the $500 that David withdrew for emergency repairs to his air conditioning system would be subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty because it does not fall under any of the exceptions.

Based on this analysis:

- The $2,000 used for tuition is exempt from the additional tax.
- The $500 used for emergency repairs incurs the additional 10% tax.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
b. $500 for emergency repairs
