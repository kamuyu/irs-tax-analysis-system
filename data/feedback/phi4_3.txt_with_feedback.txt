Q1: Advanced Scenario 3: Test Questions
6. Mary is eligible to contribute an additional $__________ to her HSA because she is age 55 or older.
a. $0
b. $850
c. $1,000
d. $2,000

A1: To determine how much more Mary can contribute to her Health Savings Account (HSA) for the year, we need to consider a few factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the HSA contribution limit is $3,850 for individuals with self-only coverage under a high deductible health plan (HDHP). People who are age 55 or older can make an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000.

2. **Mary's Contributions**: 
   - Mary contributed $2,000 herself.
   - Her mother contributed $1,000.

3. **Total Contributions Made**: The total contributions made to Mary’s HSA is $3,000 ($2,000 by Mary and $1,000 by her mother).

4. **Eligible Contribution Including Catch-up**: Since Mary is 58 years old, she can make the additional catch-up contribution of $1,000 on top of the standard limit.

5. **Total Eligible Contribution for Mary**:
   - Standard Limit: $3,850
   - Catch-Up Contribution (age 55 or older): $1,000

   Total: $4,850

6. **Additional Contribution Allowed**: Since $3,000 has already been contributed to the HSA ($2,000 by Mary and $1,000 by her mother), she can still contribute an additional:

   \[ \$4,850 - \$3,000 = \$1,850 \]

However, Mary herself cannot contribute more than the standard limit plus her catch-up amount. Since she has already contributed $2,000 to reach part of this limit, she can contribute an additional:

\[ (\$3,850 + \$1,000) - \$2,000 = \$2,850 \]

But considering the question specifically asks about her eligibility due to age (catch-up contribution), the additional amount attributable directly to being 55 or older is $1,000.

Thus, Mary is eligible to contribute an additional **$1,000** because she is age 55 or older.

The correct answer is:
c. $1,000

Q2: 7. Form 8889, Part I is used to report HSA contributions made by _______________.
a. Mary
b. Mary's employer
c. Mary's mother
d. All of the above

A2: Form 8889, Part I is used to report Health Savings Account (HSA) contributions made by:

- **Mary** (individual contributions)
- **Mary's employer** (if any)
- **Other individuals**, such as Mary’s mother, who can contribute to her HSA

In this scenario:
- Mary contributed $2,000.
- Her mother contributed an additional $1,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

d. All of the above

Q3: 8. What is the total unreimbursed qualified medical expenses reported on Form 8889, Part II?
a. $3,860
b. $3,620
c. $3,580
d. $3,320

A3: To determine the total unreimbursed qualified medical expenses that Mary can report on Form 8889, Part II, we need to identify which of her expenses are considered "qualified medical expenses" for HSA purposes.

Qualified medical expenses generally include payments for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and costs related to treatments affecting any part or function of the body. However, they do not typically include expenses that are cosmetic in nature or for general health items like gym memberships unless prescribed by a doctor.

Let's evaluate each of Mary's expenses:

1. **$500 for nine visits to a physical therapist after her knee surgery** - Qualified medical expense.
2. **$1,000 unreimbursed doctor bills** - Qualified medical expense.
3. **$280 prescription medicine** - Qualified medical expense.
4. **$1,500 replacement of a crown** - Qualified dental expense (considered qualified if it is for treatment and not cosmetic).
5. **$300 deep cleaning for teeth** - Qualified dental expense (typically qualifies as maintenance).
6. **$40 over the counter medication** - Not qualified unless prescribed by a doctor.
7. **$260 gym membership** - Not a qualified medical expense, unless prescribed by a doctor.

Now we add up only the qualified expenses:

- Physical therapy: $500
- Doctor bills: $1,000
- Prescription medicine: $280
- Replacement of crown: $1,500
- Deep cleaning for teeth: $300

Total qualified medical expenses = $500 + $1,000 + $280 + $1,500 + $300 = $3,580

Thus, the total unreimbursed qualified medical expenses reported on Form 8889, Part II is **$3,580**.

The correct answer is:
c. $3,580
